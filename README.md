# The Warehouse
'The Warehouse' is a Python-based application developed using the Tkinter library, designed to streamline material quality management in manufacturing. With a user-friendly interface, it allows users to input and manage information such as Batch Number, Material Name, Type, Import Date, Supplier details, Test Validity, Cost, and Weight.
Key features include adding, displaying, clearing, deleting, and updating records. The application utilizes an SQLite database ('qa_system.db') to store and organize data securely. It cleverly manages unique identifiers for records, ensuring each entry gets a distinct ID based on the maximum existing ID. This enables smooth deletion and renumbering of records without compromising system functionality.
Catering to quality control personnel and production managers, the system provides an intuitive solution for maintaining and monitoring material quality. Its design and robust capabilities make it an essential tool for organizations committed to upholding the highest standards in their manufacturing processes.
